# Capstone Project Proposal

* [Requirements (flexible)](https://gist.github.com/matt-winzer/745abaadb509371dfee2a756c8da0c5e)

## Project Description
This app will be designed to find the best fitting clothing size for a user, based on body measurements input manually or imported from 3D body scanner data.


## Problem Statement
Online shopping for clothing is growing in popularity, but it is surprisingly inefficient. Finding the correct size can be difficult for buyers, and often either the buyer or the retailer will end up incurring additional costs (monetary and environmental) in the form of return shipping for clothes that do not fit.


## How will your project solve this problem?
This app will cut down on return shipping costs and increase buyer confidence by providing an accurate estimate of best-fit before ordering.


## 5 user stories (at least):

* As a user I can create a personal profile
* As a user I can input my body measurements manually and add them to my profile
* As a user I can search for clothing from different retailers
* As a user I can compare different sizes of a particular article of clothing and see which will fit best
* As a user I can add articles of clothing that I like to a wishlist
* As a user I can click a button that takes me to a retailer page where the item is available for sale

## What technologies do you plan to use?

This does not need to be an exhaustive list. We want you to identify major technologies you will be using. This list may grow or shrink as your project progresses.

* React Native
* Node/Express
* Puppeteer & Apify
